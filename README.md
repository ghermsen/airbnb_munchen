# Data Analysis from Airbnb - M端nchen

The IPO (Initial Public Offering, that is, the process in which a private company goes public by selling its shares to the general public) of [Airbnb](https://www.airbnb.com) took place on December 9, 2020, and its shares started trading on December 10, 2020. On that day, the company's shares were worth USD144.71, an incredible 112.00% more than the USD68.00 value set by the company in its IPO, making the company reach the mark of USD100 Billion in market value, surpassing giants from hotel industries like Marriott International, Hilton, and Hyatt.

The Startup, founded in 2008, offers an attractive and easy-to-use platform for its users, connecting travelers or people who want to stay in a property and hosts (people who prefer to rent their property for a short time). Airbnb is present in more than 80,000 cities worldwide and has hosted more than 300 million people, and it is considered by many to be the largest hotel company today, and the main detail is: Airbnb does not have any hotels!

One of Airbnb's initiatives is to provide website data for some of the world's major cities. Through the [Inside Airbnb](http://insideairbnb.com/get-the-data.html), it is possible to download a large amount of data to develop Data Science projects and solutions.

**In this project, we will analyze the data for the city of M端nchen and see which insights can be extracted from raw data.**
